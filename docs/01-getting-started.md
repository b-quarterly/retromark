# Getting Started

Welcome to RetroMark! This guide will walk you through installing the CLI and creating your first retro-styled site.

## Installation

You don't need to install anything globally. RetroMark can be run directly using `npx`, which comes bundled with Node.js.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js (version 18.0.0 or higher)

## Step 1: Initialize a New Project

The easiest way to start is with the `init` command. This will create a new directory with a sample site structure.

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
npx retromark init my-retro-site
```
